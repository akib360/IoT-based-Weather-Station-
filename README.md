# IoT-based-Weather-Station

# Needed Component:
  # Hardware: 
  1. Sensor (DHT11)
  2. Raspberry Pi
  

Collect Weather Information using DHT11 and Raspberry Pi 3 and send data to ThingSpeak .

# DHT11 : 
DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor is a calibrated digital signal output with the temperature and humidity sensor complex. The sensor comprises a resistive type humidity sensitive element and a NTC element, and a high performance 8bit single chip microcomputer is connected.

# RaspberryPi : 
The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.

# ThingSpeak :  
"ThingSpeak is an open source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. ThingSpeak enables the creation of sensor logging applications, location tracking applications, and a social network of things with status updates.
